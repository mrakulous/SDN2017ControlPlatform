# SDN2017ControlPlatform

This is a simple GUI for the 2017 SDN project.  This application is used as a "control platform" for users to control an SDN home network.  Features include host-blocking, switch-blocking, traffic rerouting, and bandwidth control.  Network virtualization will be added at a later date. This application uses 3rd party services (Opendaylight, Hyperglance) which are required for full functionality.

This app was made using the Ionic 2.
